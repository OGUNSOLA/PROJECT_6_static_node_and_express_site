        .about-bio

          p Hi there! I am Bukola. I am passionate about building things especially with codes and micro-controllers. My first experience with coding was at the university but I didnt pay much attention to it then. After graduating I wanted to take a robotic course on coursera.org and it required knowledge of MATLAB. I started learning MATLAB and I realised how much I loved coding. I have since then learnt JavaScript, C++, C# but I am more passionate about JavaScript. I took up a frontend web development course at teamtreehouse.com and currently leaning fullstack JavaScript. I am seeking full-time or part-time role in a company where I can help the company grow while learning more
